This course provides an introduction to nextflow and nf-core. The topics covered will include basic concepts on bash scripting and linux OS, containers and environments. Then we will show how nextflow can be used to build automatized and reproducible workflows for biological and genomics data analysis.

The course is organized in six chapters, covering topics listed below. All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in Python and R. No prior experience on statistics or programming is required for the attendance of this course.

# Roadmap of the course

## Chapter 1. Hello world with nextflow.

- Hello world with nexftlow.

## Chapter 2. Containers: docker & singularity.

- Containers: docker and singularity.

## Chapter 3. Genomics with nexftlow.

- Genomics with nexftlow.

## Chapter 4. Processes, channels, operators.

- Processes, channels, operators.

## Chapter 5. Config, environments, resource usage.

- Modules in nextflow: modular workflow, efficiency and optimization.

## Chapter 6. Test & debug, nf-core and sequera.

- Test and debug a nextflow workflow.
- nf-core: Standardized and reproducible pipelines.
- Sequera platform: cloud running nextflow.

## Setup

We will be working with Visual Studio Code / Gitpod / RStudio as main editors. Although recommended, they do not need to be installed in your local computers, since we will use Codespaces provided by Github, which already implement an interface ready to program an execute the code.
Notebook versions are also useful, such as Jupyter notebooks (for the Python version), or Rmd files (for the R version). 
If you want to use notebooks for the practical sessions, we recommend install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com in advance of the workshop.

## Getting Started

1. Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .py / .R examples.

3. Open a Codespace where we will be using either Visual Studio Code / RStudio fro the practical sessions.

4. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder:
