### Chapter 9. Hello modules

So far we've been running Nextflow workflows on our local machine using the command line interface. In this section, we'll introduce you to Seqera Platform, a powerful cloud-based platform for running, monitoring, and sharing Nextflow workflows.

You'll learn how to use Seqera Platform within Nextflow CLI, the Seqera Platform GUI, and the API.
You can use Seqera Platform via either the **CLI**, through the **online GUI** or through the **API**.

### 1. Use Seqera Platform to capture and monitor Nextflow jobs launched from the CLI

### 2 Using Seqera Platform Launchpad to run Nextflow workflows
